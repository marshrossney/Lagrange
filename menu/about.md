I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh working on machine learning for lattice field theory, an exciting field spanning particle physics and high performance computing.

I completed my MPhys degree at Warwick Univeristy in 2018.
My master's research was on enhanced Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling with applications in condensed matter physics.
